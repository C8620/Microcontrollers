# Microcontrollers

This is the source code I have written during University course of Microcontrollers - programming in ARMv5 Assembly for a specialised developer board.

I have removed code for lab 6-9, to prevent later students to perform direct copy and paste.

Reuse of these code without notifying the lecturer will be found.
